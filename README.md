This repository is created by NYU Abu Dhabi Arts & Humanities Postgraduate Research Fellow Nada Ammagui. It contains detailed information on artworks/installations, artists, and venues from every edition of the Sharjah Biennial from 1993–2019.
The data in this repository is organized in a spreadsheet containing artwork, artist, and geographic data for Sharjah Biennial exhibitions from 1993–2019 as well as photographs taken by the creator (Nada Ammagui) at Sharjah Biennial 14.
